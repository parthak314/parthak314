## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Partha
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a strong foundation in Python, C++, SQL, and various other technologies. I enjoy tackling challenging problems, building efficient solutions, and continually learning new skills to stay at the forefront of software development.
### ðŸ“ˆ Projects
My GitHub projects showcase a blend of practical applications, experimental builds, and ongoing learning projects. Some of my repositories are public and available for you to explore. Note: Certain projects are under active development (currently below version v1.0.0) and have been privatised until they are ready for public release.

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On
#### Currently, I'm focused on:
- Developing new full-stack applications that integrate Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Firebase and AES-256 encryption and OAuth2.0 (social logins) for performance and scalability.
- Implementing an SIEM system using the ELK stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana)

#### With future projects around:
- Experimenting with machine learning algorithms and data science tools for data-driven problem-solving.
- Building tools for personal use that automate everyday tasks and optimize workflows.

Once these projects reach significant milestones, Iâ€™ll share them here!
